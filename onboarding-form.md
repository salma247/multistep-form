# Storing Onboarding Form Information in the Database

## Proposed Solution

Currently, the endpoint that returns the onboarding form (`GET /api/onboarding`) returns hardcoded data. To store the information in the database, the following changes would need to be made to the existing database structure and the handling of user responses:

1. **Database Changes:**

   - **Create Tables:** Create a new table named `OnboardingFormField` to store the metadata for each onboarding form field. This table would contain columns such as `name`, `label`, `type`, and `required`.


   - **Create Relationships:** Establish a relationship between the `OnboardingFormField` table and the existing `User` table. This relationship would allow us to associate each user's onboarding responses with the appropriate form fields.
   e.g. `OnboardingFormField` has a one-to-many relationship with `UserOnboardingResponse`.

2. **Onboarding Form Storage:**

   - When a new form field is introduced, a new record is inserted into the `OnboardingFormField` table with the corresponding metadata.

3. **Saving User Responses:**

   - When a user submits their onboarding responses, the data is first validated against the metadata stored in the `OnboardingFormField` table.
   - User responses are then stored in a new table named `UserOnboardingResponse`. This table would contain columns like `user_id` (foreign key), `field_id` (foreign key), and `value`.

4. **Retrieving Onboarding Form:**

   - The `GET /api/onboarding` endpoint would now query the `OnboardingFormField` table to retrieve the form metadata. This ensures that any changes to the form are reflected dynamically.
   - User responses can be fetched by joining the `UserOnboardingResponse` table with the `OnboardingFormField` table, filtering by the user's ID.


## Considerations

1. **Data Validation:**

   - Proper validation of user responses against the form metadata is crucial to ensure data integrity. Fields like `required` and `type` should be validated before storing user responses.

2. **Data Consistency:**

   - As the form structure evolves over time, updating the `OnboardingFormField` table should be a carefully managed process to avoid inconsistencies with existing data.

3. **User Privacy and Security:**

   - Sensitive user data, such as email addresses, should be handled securely. Proper data encryption and access controls must be in place.

4. **Migration Strategy:**

   - When transitioning from hardcoded data to a database-backed form, a data migration plan should be developed to transfer existing onboarding form data to the new database tables.

5. **Performance Optimization:**

   - Indexes on foreign keys and relevant columns can help improve query performance, especially when fetching user responses.

6. **Scalability:**

   - The chosen database system should be able to handle the expected load and scale as user base and form complexity increase.

7. **API Evolution:**

   - The API endpoints may need to be versioned to accommodate changes in the form structure over time without breaking existing client applications.

By implementing these changes, we can store onboarding form information in the database, allowing for dynamic form updates and providing a more scalable and maintainable solution for handling user responses.
